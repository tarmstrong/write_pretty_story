# Write Pretty Story. Don't edit.

This is a little web app that makes your writing pretty as you write it. It also don't give you a way of editing what you've written.

Features yet to be implemented:
* Saving. Right now all you can do is copy and paste. (Might use HTML5 local storage or come up with a server system.)
* Sharing. If this was on a server, it would be nice to give someone a read-only link to your story.
